# RelativisticScatteringSimulation
A package for simulating particle collisions with nice visuals.
The package fully adheres to special relativity, but does not 
realistically model lepton and hadron interactions. Fundamental
particles are modelled as spheres, with arbitrarily-chosen annihilation
and decay probabilities. Composite particles are modelled as collections
of these spheres bound by springs to a core.

The purpose of this package is to demonstrate Effective Field Theory 
principles. A measurement
suite is currently being developed to measure the model's "parton" 
densities in two ways: through "Deep-Inelastic scattering" (lepton-proton)
experiments, and also through truth-level data collection of parton 
energy-momenta. These can be compared, perhaps providing a deeper 
understanding of how lightcone-distribution densities are related to their
corresponding rest-frame momentum distributions. Meanwhile
these measured densities can be used, owing to the factorization of
Effective Field Theory, to predict the cross section of hadron-hadron 
scattering.
